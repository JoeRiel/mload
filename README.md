mload: A Bash Script for Creating Maple Archives
================================================

**mload** is a bash script that loads Maple source files into a Maple
library archive (*.mla* file).  It uses tty maple and supports both
short and GNU-style long options.  It is a replacement for *sload*, a
Maplesoft internal tool.  Maple is a computer algebra system sold by
[Maplesoft](http://www.maplesoft.com/).

The source, **mload.nw**, for the shell script is a literate program
written with [noweb](https://github.com/nrnrnr/noweb) and the
[knoweb](htttps://github.com/JoeRiel/knoweb) extension.  The prebuilt
shell script and its documentation are included in the release, as
**mload** and **mload.pdf**.
